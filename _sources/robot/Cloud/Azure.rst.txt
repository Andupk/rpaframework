:Library scope: Global

Library for interacting with Azure services

Authentication to Azure API is handled by `service subcription key` which
can set for all services using environment variable `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`.

If there are service specific subscription keys, these can be set using
environment variable `AZURE_SERVICENAME_KEY`. Replace `SERVICENAME` with service
name.
