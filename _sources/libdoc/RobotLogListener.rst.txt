:Library scope: Global

RPA Framework library which implements Robot Framework Listener v2 interface.

Is used to filter out logging for specified parts of the task execution.

********
Keywords
********

:End Keyword:
  :Arguments: name, attributes

  Listener method for keyword end.

  If `name` exists in the protected keywords list then log level is
  restored back to level it was before settings to NONE.


:Mute Run On Failure:
  :Arguments: keywords: typing.Any = None, optional_keyword_to_run: str = None

  Set keywords which should not execute `SeleniumLibrary`
  default behaviour of running keyword on failure.

  Keyword names do not need to be full names of keywords, ie. all keywords
  matching even partially will be affected. `Run Keyword` would match all
  `BuiltIn` library keywords (17 keywords in RF 3.2.1) and of course all
  `Run Keyword` named keywords in any resource and/or library file which
  are imported would be matched also.

  By default `SeleniumLibrary` executes `Capture Page Screenshot`
  on failure.

  If `optional_keyword_to_run` is not given then nothing is done
  on failure, but this can be set to override `SeleniumLibrary`
  default behaviour for a set of keywords.


:Only Info Level:
  :Arguments: names: typing.Any = None

  Register keywords that are allowed only INFO level logging


:Register Protected Keywords:
  :Arguments: names: typing.Any = None

  Register keywords that are not going to be logged into Robot Framework logs.


:Start Keyword:
  :Arguments: name, attributes

  Listener method for keyword start.

  If `name` exists in the protected keywords list then log level is
  temporarily set to NONE.
