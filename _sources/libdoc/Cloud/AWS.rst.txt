:Get Cells:
  [summary]


:Get Document Analysis:
  :Arguments: job_id: str = None, max_results: int = 1000, next_token: str = None

  Get the results of Textract asynchronous `Document Analysis` operation

  Response dictionary has key `JobStatus` with value `SUCCEEDED` when analysis
  has been completed.


  Example:

  .. code-block:: robotframework

      Init Textract Client  %{AWS_KEY_ID}  %{AWS_KEY_SECRET}  %{AWS_REGION}
      ${jobid}=    Start Document Analysis  s3bucket_name  invoice.pdf
      FOR    ${i}    IN RANGE    50
          ${response}    Get Document Analysis  ${jobid}
          Exit For Loop If    "${response}[JobStatus]" == "SUCCEEDED"
          Sleep    1s
      END

:Get Document Text Detection:
  :Arguments: job_id: str = None, max_results: int = 1000, next_token: str = None

  Get the results of Textract asynchronous `Document Text Detection` operation

  Response dictionary has key `JobStatus` with value `SUCCEEDED` when analysis
  has been completed.


  Example:

  .. code-block:: robotframework

      Init Textract Client  %{AWS_KEY_ID}  %{AWS_KEY_SECRET}  %{AWS_REGION}
      ${jobid}=    Start Document Text Detection  s3bucket_name  invoice.pdf
      FOR    ${i}    IN RANGE    50
          ${response}    Get Document Text Detection    ${jobid}
          Exit For Loop If    "${response}[JobStatus]" == "SUCCEEDED"
          Sleep    1s
      END

:Get Pages And Text:
  :Arguments: textract_response: dict

  Get pages and text out of Textract response json


:Get Tables:
  [summary]


:Get Words:
  [summary]


:Init Comprehend Client:
  :Arguments: aws_key_id: str = None, aws_key: str = None, region: str = None, use_robocloud_vault: bool = False

  Initialize AWS S3 client


:Init Sqs Client:
  :Arguments: aws_key_id: str = None, aws_key: str = None, region: str = None, queue_url: str = None, use_robocloud_vault: bool = False

  Initialize AWS SQS client


:Init Textract Client:
  :Arguments: aws_key_id: str = None, aws_key: str = None, region: str = None, use_robocloud_vault: bool = False

  Initialize AWS Textract client


:List Buckets:
  List all buckets for this account


:List Files:
  :Arguments: bucket_name

  List files in the bucket


:Receive Message:
  Receive message from queue


:Send Message:
  :Arguments: message: str = None, message_attributes: dict = None

  Send message to the queue


:Set Robocloud Vault:
  :Arguments: vault_name

  Set Robocloud Vault name


:Start Document Analysis:
  :Arguments: bucket_name_in: str = None, object_name_in: str = None, object_version_in: str = None, bucket_name_out: str = None, prefix_object_out: str = textract_output

  Starts the asynchronous analysis of an input document
  for relationships between detected items such as key-value pairs,
  tables, and selection elements.

  Input object can be in JPEG, PNG or PDF format. Documents should
  be located in the Amazon S3 bucket.

  By default Amazon Textract will save the analysis result internally
  to be accessed by keyword ``Get Document Analysis``. This can
  be overridden by giving parameter ``bucket_name_out``.


:Start Document Text Detection:
  :Arguments: bucket_name_in: str = None, object_name_in: str = None, object_version_in: str = None, bucket_name_out: str = None, prefix_object_out: str = textract_output

  Starts the asynchronous detection of text in a document.
  Amazon Textract can detect lines of text and the words that make up a
  line of text.

  Input object can be in JPEG, PNG or PDF format. Documents should
  be located in the Amazon S3 bucket.

  By default Amazon Textract will save the analysis result internally
  to be accessed by keyword ``Get Document Text Detection``. This can
  be overridden by giving parameter ``bucket_name_out``.


:Upload File:
  :Arguments: bucket_name: str = None, filename: str = None, object_name: str = None

  Upload single file into bucket

  If `object_name` is not given then basename of the file is
  used as `object_name`.


:Upload Files:
  :Arguments: bucket_name: str = None, files: list = None

  Upload multiple files into bucket

  Giving files as list of filepaths:
      ['/path/to/file1.txt', '/path/to/file2.txt']

  Giving files as list of dictionaries (including filepath and object name):
      [{'filepath':'/path/to/file1.txt', 'object_name': 'file1.txt'},
      {'filepath': '/path/to/file2.txt', 'object_name': 'file2.txt'}]
