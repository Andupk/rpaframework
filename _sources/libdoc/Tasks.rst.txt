:Library scope: Global

`Tasks` is a Robot Framework library for controlling
task execution inside a suite. It allows changing the next scheduled task
or jumping immediately to other tasks by using the keywords it provides.

If ``Graphviz`` is available, it will also create a directed graph
to visualize connected tasks, which is visible in the suite documentation
field of the test log.

:Jump To Task:
  :Arguments: name

  :Arguments: task, keyword, \*args

  Executes given keyword and jumps to given task if it succeeds.
